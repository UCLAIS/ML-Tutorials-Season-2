The dimensions of each of these will be the same as the dimensions of the variables we are taking the derivative with respect to. In `backward()`, we return these derivatives as a tuple. `dx` is used as the `dout` for the previous layer (recall how backpropagation works!), while `dw` and `db` will be used to update the filter weights and biases respectively via gradient descent. The details of how to do this are omitted from this notebook to keep it short, but the implementation should be relatively straightforward once you have these gradients.\n",

We already know $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial o}$ — this is the upstream gradient `dout`.

    "The forward pass code is simple. We simply iterate through each image region similarly to convolutional layers and take the max element in each region. The difference with the convolutional layer is that the image regions are non-overlapping. We also remember to cache the input `x` so that we can refer to it in the backpropagation phase. \n",

    "\n",
    "Remember that max pooling layers have no learnable weights! Our aim with backpropagation here is to simply compute `dx`, so that we can pass it as `dout` for the previous layer (most likely a ReLU layer) so that gradients propagate through our entire model and weights are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping this in mind, let's think about how to compute $\\frac{\\partial o}{\\partial x}$, where again we denote the result of max pooling as $o$ (remember that if we have  $\\frac{\\partial o}{\\partial x}$, we can compute $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x}$ because we already have $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial o}$). During the forward pass, we take the max value in every `2 x 2` region. Therefore, intuitively, every other value in the region that is not the max will not change the output $o$. These values therefore have 0 gradient. For the max value, we simply assign the corresponding gradient value.

    "\n",
    "First, once we load the MNIST dataset, we scale the images so that each pixel is in the [0,1] range instead of [0,255]. This makes it easier for us to train the CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we add a fourth dimension to the `x_train` and `x_test` tensors, which were initially of size `N x 28 x 28`, where `N` is the number of images. The last dimension we add represents the number of channels each image has, which is 1 because in MNIST we are working with greyscale images. For RGB, you would set this to 3. Also note that we add the number of channels as the last dimension in the Keras example. This is the standard adopted by Keras and Tensorflow. In our `numpy` implementation above, we adopted the convention used in `PyTorch`, the other major framework for machine learning, where the number of channels goes before the width and height of the image (i.e. a single image would be represented by a tensor of shape `1 x 28 x 28` instead of `28 x 28 x 1`).

    "By default, `y_train` and `y_test` are arrays that contain single integers representing the digit that each image represents. Keras, however, expects each target label to be a **10-dimensional** vector. Therefore, we use `to_categorical()` from `keras.utils` to obtain an array of one-hot encoded vector. That is to say, if our target is 5, then after calling `to_categorical()`, we would get the zero-indexed array `[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]`.\n",

To recap, we walked you through how CNNs can be implemented from scratch in Python using just `numpy`, and we've seen how we can specify and train the same CNN model using **Keras** to reach a ~97.5% test accuracy on the MNIST dataset. Hopefully, the next time you use Keras or PyTorch or Tensorflow or any other similar libraries, remember that all they're doing at a high level is abstracting away the theory and code we've covered in this notebook (except they're vectorized / optimised for the GPU and thus often significantly faster)."
